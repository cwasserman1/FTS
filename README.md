# FTS Backtesting Software
This project is the algorithmic trading platform for NYU Fintech Society(FTS). The goal of this project is to have working backtesting/analysis and live trading software. We are currently sketching the backtesting software in jupyter notebooks but will transfer it to a more cohesive project structure when functional enough.
